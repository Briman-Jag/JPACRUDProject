## JPA C.R.U.D. Homework

### Week 9 Weekend Project at Skill Distillery

### Overview:

This program is designed to a be website application that allows users to create, read, update and delete data from a single beer list database table, which was created in MySQL Workbench.

Project Requirements:

* Your project utilizes a MySQL database to manipulate data. For this project you are only required to have a single table and entity.

* The MySQL table is mapped to a valid JPA Entity and tested to ensure the mappings are working correctly.

* A Spring project allows for a user to perform basic CRUD operations on your entity via a web interface.

* Your project and database are deployed to your AWS instance.

### How to run:

The homepage for Brian's Beer List allows the user to look up a Beer using the Beer ID, press a button to add a beer to the list, or click on the name of the beer to view a full list of the beers description. The display pages for the beers give the users the option to update the various fields related to the beer or delete the beers from the list and database completely. The add beer to list button allows the user to input information about a beer such as name, brewery name, brewery location, style, alchohol by volume, international bitterness units, and rating for the beer. It then adds it to the database.

### Technologies used:

Java, MySQL Workbench, JPQL, Spring Boot, Java Persistence API(JPA), Data Access Object(DAO) pattern, JUNIT Tests, Gradle, SQL, MySQL, Apache, Tomcat, AWS EC2, Atom, and Github.

### Topics implemented:

* Setup of Spring Boot.
* Creating a SQL database.
* Configuring a JPA project.
* Creating JUnit tests to ensure JPA mappings are correct.
* Integrating a MySQL workbench table with a JPA project.
* Performing basic CRUD operations.
* Tomcat8 on AWS EC2 Instance.
* JSP Standard Tag Library to generate HTML.
* Relational Databases: SQL Databases and Java Database Connectivity.
* Java Libraries: SQL, ArrayList, and Lists.
* Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation.
* Test Driven Development using JUNIT.

### Lessons learned:

This project aided me in better understanding how to create a table using MySQL workbench, how to get Java to utilize that table using JPA, how to JUNIT test to ensure the database is communicating with the web application, and how to implement a users web based capabilities to create, read, update, and delete data from a SQL database.
